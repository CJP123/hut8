My name is Clive from Auckland, New Zealand. 

I have a Degree in Mechanical Engineering and in Economics. I have spent till now as an Engineer who has worked exentensively in Heavy Industry (Oil+Gas / Thermal Power Plants) and some work in the Dairy Industry in Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). 

I followed advances in ML / AI over the last few years but was really pushed over the edge by fast.ai which made the process of learning accessible. Python and pytorch were a steep learning curve but being able to replicate, adapt and generate ideas into code has become a passion. 

I have four kids who are as passionately bored of my ML / AI converations but the virtual ML community and hopefully this blog will fill this void.

The focus in this blog will be to record some areas of interest and maybe explain a bit of theory. Hopefully I will look back with embarassment at my early posts as I improve in both code and writing ability.

I am very happy to receive constructive feedback. Please feel free to reach out to me via twitter.
